# Blender 2.79

- **cornellBox-2.79-babylon-standard.blend**: standard workflow scene using (not yet deprecated but soon) [Blender2Babylon exporter 5.6](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Exporters/tree/master/Blender), exporting `.babylon` file to `BJS-runtime/babylon-standard/` folder
- **cornellBox-2.79-gltf.blend**: PBR workflow scene using (now deprecated) [gltf exporter](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter), exporting `.gltf/.glb` file to `BJS-runtime/gltf/` & `BJS-runtime/glb/` folders. This scene will soon be replaced by *cornellBox-2.80-gltf.blend* when Blender 2.8 will quit beta.
- **cornellBox-2.79-Cycles.blend**: precomputed Cycle scene serving as ligthmap rendering, and not for export. [Baketool addon](https://blendermarket.com/products/baketool) is used to render.
